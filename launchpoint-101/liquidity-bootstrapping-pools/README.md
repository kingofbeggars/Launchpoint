***

* **The pool**: An LBP creates a pool where your new project's tokens are paired with another established cryptocurrency, like Solana (SOL).&#x20;
* **Dynamic pricing**: Unlike traditional launches with a fixed price, LBPs use a dynamic pricing model. The price of your token starts high and gradually decreases over a set period of time.&#x20;
* **Fair access**: This dynamic pricing prevents early buyers or bots from grabbing a large portion of tokens at a low price. Everyone who participates throughout the LBP period has the opportunity to purchase tokens at a fair market value.&#x20;
* **Improved liquidity**: As users buy tokens from the pool, they also add liquidity to the pool. This initial injection of liquidity helps stabilize the price of your token after the launch.&#x20;

> _In simpler terms, LBPs create a transparent and automated system for launching your project's token. The dynamic pricing discourages manipulation and ensures everyone has a fair chance to participate in the launch. This also lays the groundwork for a more stable market for your token in the long run._

### Understanding liquidity bootstrapping pools (LBPs)

**What are LBPs?**

LBPs are innovative smart contracts that enable dynamic token price discovery during fundraising events. Unlike traditional token sales with a fixed price, LBPs utilize a time-dependent weighting system to adjust the ratio of two tokens within a pool. This allows the token price to gradually decrease over a predetermined timeframe, reflecting market demand.

**Conceptualizing LBPs:**

Imagine setting a high initial price for your LBP as a starting point, not an absolute value. This counterintuitive approach allows the LBP's dynamic weight adjustments to take effect, progressively lowering the price until a market equilibrium is reached. This approach discourages early buyers seeking immediate gains and incentivizes them to wait for a more favorable price point.

**Benefits of LBPs:**

* **Mitigating sell pressure:** As the weight of one token in the pool decreases, it experiences controlled sell pressure, while the other token experiences corresponding buy pressure. This, combined with moderate trading volume, helps the price converge towards a fair market valuation.
* **Promoting fair distribution:** LBPs often begin with intentionally high starting prices, deterring large investors from acquiring a significant portion of the pool liquidity early on. This fosters a more equitable distribution of tokens within the community, especially for early-stage projects.
* **Reduced capital requirements:** Launching an LBP allows projects to bootstrap liquidity for their tokens with minimal starting capital. Compared to traditional methods, LBPs require a smaller initial investment of the secondary token within the pool. This strategy minimizes upfront costs while still achieving the desired liquidity goals.&#x20;
  * As an example, starting with a 20% share of <mark style="color:purple;">**$**</mark>SOL allows for a smoother price decline compared to a 50/50 split, ultimately resulting in the project holding more of the desired token (e.g., project token) upon LBP completion. This approach also helps avoid extreme price volatility often associated with traditional 50/50 launch pools.

**Real-world LBP use cases:**

* **LaunchPoint integration:** LaunchPoint leverages LBPs to empower project creators with a secure and transparent fundraising mechanism. Our custom-built LBPs, designed specifically for the Solana blockchain, ensure fair and efficient project launches, fostering a thriving Web3 fundraising ecosystem.
* **Gitcoin's AKITA/ETH LBP:** This LBP example showcases the gradual distribution of tokens back to the community. The LBP mechanism allows for controlled sell pressure while raising additional funds for future initiatives.

By incorporating LBPs into your fundraising strategy, you can unlock a range of benefits, including fairer token distribution, reduced capital requirements, and a more controlled price discovery process. LaunchPoint empowers you to leverage the power of LBPs within the Solana ecosystem, fostering a successful and transparent Web3 fundraising experience.
