### Components

If you are have never interacted with an LBS platform, we have made a list with possible unfamiliar terms in order to have an easy and pleasant first experience.

***

* **Pool creator:** The pool creator function allows users to define the parameters and initiate a Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP) on the platform.
* **Token:** This function specifies the token being offered for sale in the Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP).
* **Start time:** This function defines the exact time when the LBP becomes active and trading begins.
* **End time:** This function sets the predetermined time when the LBP concludes and trading ceases.
* **Initial price:** The starting price of your project's token in the LBP pool. This price is typically set higher to prevent early manipulation.
* **Initial amounts:** The pool is initially seeded with the SOL and Token parity that combined with the initial weight define the initial price.
* **Spot/current price:** The final price of your project's token in the LBP pool. The price gradually decreases from the initial price to this ending price over the course of the LBP.
* **Weights:** In an LBP, weights determine the relative ratio between your project's tokens and the other coin in the pool. These weights influence the price curve. For example, a higher weight for your token initially would result in a slower price decrease.
* **Liquidity:** Liquidity refers to the ease with which a token can be bought or sold on a cryptocurrency exchange. LBPs help jumpstart liquidity for your project's token by creating a pool with both your tokens and another established coin.
* **Liquidity providers:** Users who add funds (tokens or established coins) to the LBP pool are considered liquidity providers. They contribute to the smooth functioning of the launch and earn rewards in return.
* **Token allocation:** This refers to the total number of tokens made available for purchase through the LBP. The allocation determines how many tokens users can buy based on the amount they contribute to the pool.
* **Price curve:** The price curve in an LBP depicts the relationship between the total amount of tokens sold and the corresponding price. It typically starts high and slopes downwards as more tokens are sold.
* **Swap fee:** A small fee charged on every token swap (purchase) within the LBP. This fee can be used to incentivize liquidity providers or be directed to the project's treasury.
