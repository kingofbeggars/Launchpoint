<mark style="color:purple;">**Solana**</mark> on-chain activity outpaces launch infrastructure.
{% endhint %}

> _In a fast paced environment_ with high volume and liquidity surges, the general user is the most exposed to every possible <mark style="color:red;">**vulnerability**</mark>. **A fair launch mechanism** acts as a <mark style="color:blue;">**protective coating**</mark> and puts emphasis on fairness from both a conceptual and a technical perspective.

* **Early-stage** projects seeking fair and efficient fundraising face a critical challenge: predatory practices like sniping and MEV exploit vulnerabilities in fast-paced launches with high volume and liquidity surges.
* **A fair launch mechanism** can act as a shield, promoting a level playing field for all participants. By emphasizing fairness from both conceptual and technical perspectives, these mechanisms can help establish balanced market dynamics and empower promising early-stage projects.
