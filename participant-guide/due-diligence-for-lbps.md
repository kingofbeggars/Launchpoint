# ðŸ”Ž Due diligence for LBPs

{% hint style="danger" %}
The **Multi-layered** vetted mechanism initiated by the **UAP DAO** has the purpose of protecting any investors by thoroughly researching projects before awarding them with the <mark style="background-color:green;">**âœ” Curated**</mark> label.

However, in the case of <mark style="background-color:orange;">âœ˜</mark> <mark style="background-color:orange;"></mark><mark style="background-color:orange;">**Uncurated**</mark> projects of a more <mark style="color:red;">**DEGEN**</mark> nature, we recommend following the guide below.

### Curated LBPs

* **Below** you can find a visual representation of a <mark style="background-color:green;">âœ”</mark> <mark style="background-color:green;"></mark><mark style="background-color:green;">**Curated**</mark> pool and its main indicator. We advise all users to pay thorough attention to this indicator despite the filtering method of the pools. \

### Uncurated LBPs

* **Below** you can find a visual representation of a <mark style="background-color:orange;">âœ˜</mark> <mark style="background-color:orange;"></mark><mark style="background-color:orange;">**Uncurated**</mark> pool and its main indicator. We advise all users to pay thorough attention to this indicator despite the filtering method of the pools.

### Risk score

* Another very important factor that every user should verify before investing into an LBP is the Risk Score and its expanded criteria:
  *   <mark style="color:green;">**Revoking the mint authority**</mark> for a token after an LBP is crucial for several reasons:

      * **Security:** It prevents unauthorized creation of additional tokens after the LBP has concluded. An LBP is designed to distribute a fixed supply of tokens. If the mint authority remains active, someone could potentially mint more tokens, diluting the value of those already distributed and harming investors.
      * **Transparency and trust:** Revoking mint authority demonstrates transparency and fosters trust with investors. It shows that the project team is committed to a fair and controlled distribution as defined by the LBP parameters.
      * **Market stability:** An uncontrolled supply of tokens can negatively impact the token's price in the market. Revoking mint authority helps maintain a predictable and stable supply, as defined by the initial LBP offering.

      In simpler terms, revoking mint authority is like locking the door to a mint after all the coins have been made. It ensures there are no more surprises and protects the value of the tokens distributed through the LBP.
  * The <mark style="background-color:green;">âœ”</mark> <mark style="background-color:green;"></mark><mark style="background-color:green;">**Curated**</mark> and <mark style="background-color:orange;">âœ˜</mark> <mark style="background-color:orange;"></mark><mark style="background-color:orange;">**Uncurated**</mark> Labels are present in that said section as well, furthermore users can see the % percentage of the raised amount that is locked for the Raydium pool automatic creation.

### Do your own research without exception

Before invest into an LBP on LaunchPoint, it's crucial to do your own research (DYOR) to make informed decisions. Here are some key areas to investigate:

* **Tokenomics:** This refers to the overall structure and distribution of the project's token. Look for details like the total number of tokens in the LBP, the total supply minted, and any planned future unlocks for the team or investors.
* **Project team and backing:** Research the team behind the project. What's their experience and reputation? Who are their previous investors? A strong and transparent team inspires confidence.
* **Market potential:** Consider the project's implied market capitalization based on the token price and total supply. Does it seem reasonable compared to similar projects?
* **Liquidity:** Where will you be able to trade the tokens after the LBP? What are the plans for ongoing liquidity? Look for projects with a clear strategy for long-term trading.
* **Product and vision:** Does the project offer a unique and valuable product or service? Does their long-term vision seem achievable and sustainable?

> _By thoroughly researching these aspects, you'll gain a better understanding of the project and the potential risks and rewards involved in participating in its LBP on LaunchPoint._
