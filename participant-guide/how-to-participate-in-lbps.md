# ðŸ‘½ How to participate in LBPs

{% hint style="warning" %}
<mark style="color:orange;">Follow this step by step guide in order to successfully participate in an LBP on</mark> <mark style="color:purple;">**LaunchPoint**</mark><mark style="color:orange;">.</mark>
{% endhint %}

### Overview

LaunchPoint provides a user-friendly and transparent platform to join Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools (LBPs). Our LBPs facilitate projects to distribute their tokens directly to the community, fostering fair and open partnerships through a Dutch auction model. This innovative approach levels the playing field, giving everyone a chance to participate in exciting early-stage opportunities!\


> This guide is exclusively applicable for the Solana network.

***

### Step 1 - Fund your wallet

**->** LaunchPoint operates on the Solana blockchain. To participate in LBPs, you'll need a Solana wallet like <mark style="color:purple;">**Phantom**</mark> or <mark style="color:orange;">**Solflare**</mark>.

**->** Once you've set up your Solana wallet, you'll need to acquire the funding token required for the specific LBP you're interested in. LBPs on LaunchPoint use Solana (SOL) for funding.

**->** There are several ways to obtain SOL. You can purchase it on a cryptocurrency exchange and then transfer it to your Solana wallet. Alternatively, you can stake other cryptocurrencies to earn SOL.

_Remember, always double-check the wallet address before sending any SOL to participate in an LBP_.

### Step 2 - Connect your wallet to LaunchPoint

**->** Now that you have SOL in your Solana wallet (<mark style="color:purple;">**Phantom**</mark> or <mark style="color:orange;">**Solflare**</mark>), you're ready to connect to LaunchPoint. Head over to the LaunchPoint platform ( https://launchpoint.fi ) and initiate the connection.

**->** On the LaunchPoint website, locate the "Select Wallet" button (top right corner) and select your preferred Solana wallet (<mark style="color:purple;">**Phantom**</mark> or <mark style="color:orange;">**Solflare**</mark>) from the available options. This will initiate the connection process between your wallet and LaunchPoint.

**->** Once you've successfully connected your wallet, the "Select Wallet" button you used earlier will change to display part of your wallet address. This indicates a secure connection between your Solana wallet (<mark style="color:purple;">**Phantom**</mark> or <mark style="color:orange;">**Solflare**</mark>) and the LaunchPoint platform. You're now ready to participate in LBPs!

### Step 3 - Buying into the LBP

**->** After selecting your desired LBP on LaunchPoint, you'll be presented with an informational screen. The details displayed will vary depending on the stage of the LBP (upcoming, in progress, or concluded). The example below showcases an LBP that's currently active. Keep in mind that this example is on Devnet.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
LaunchPoint's LBPs are designed to foster a more equitable token distribution through a unique dynamic pricing mechanism. Here's how it works:

**-> Initial high price:** LBPs begin with a higher token price to discourage bots and large investors from grabbing a significant portion of the supply early on. This creates a fairer environment for everyone.

**-> Gradual price decrease:** The token price then steadily declines over the course of the LBP, reaching a more sustainable market equilibrium point. This allows participants to enter at a price they find attractive.

**Important note:** Due to this price fluctuation, careful consideration is crucial. While the initial high price discourages large buys, it also means early participation comes with a higher risk. It's important to DYOR (do your own research) and determine the best entry point for you based on your risk tolerance and the specific LBP.

In this section, indicate how much SOL you'd like to contribute to the LBP. Remember, the actual amount you'll receive in project tokens will depend on the current price of the LBP.

Approve and confirm the transaction from your wallet.

Once the transaction is complete, you will see a project token balance.

### Step 4 - You are all set!

You have now successfully bought into an LBP. You may now observe the on-going price action for the limited amount of time the particular pool that you invested in has left and trade your token as you see fit. You may only do so while the pool is on-going. After the pool timer finishes and the raise is complete,&#x20;
