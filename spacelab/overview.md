### How it all works

* **Aligned interests: **<mark style="color:orange;">**LaunchPoint**</mark> incentivizes active participants by ensuring contributor efforts directly benefit project success. This creates a strong sense of **collective purpose** and drives user engagement.
* **Sustainable growth:** By aligning incentives, <mark style="color:purple;">**LaunchPoint**</mark> fosters a **self-perpetuating cycle** where project growth fuels contributor rewards, further encouraging participation and propelling the ecosystem forward.

### UAP - the curation engine

The success-driven flywheel solves the issue of misaligned incentives:

* **Decentralised economy for curators**: turning traditional on-chain PvP mechanics into a sustainable model for early-stage project vetting.
* **Proof-of-contribution**: consensus that will reward value-add for protocol curators.
* **Space Pods**: on-chain validation of social and technical contribution

The curation's end goal is UAP, which aligns high-growth projects with deserved amounts of liquidity, community and awareness.

> _Through this innovative framework, **LaunchPoint** creates a dynamic environment where everyone benefits from contributing to a thriving Web3 future._
