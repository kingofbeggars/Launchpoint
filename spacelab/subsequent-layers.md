### Going beyond quality

**-> LaunchPoint**'s commitment to investor confidence doesn't stop at the initial filtering process. After the UAP evaluation, projects enter subsequent curation layers designed to create a **secure** and **dependable** environment.

**->** Here, **LaunchPoint** leverages the expertise of DAOs, KOLs and other specialized Web 3.0 entities. These groups possess deep knowledge in specific niches and service areas relevant to the project landscape. Incentivized through the first layer of curation, they conduct in-depth research on each applicant, expanding the vetting process beyond the UAP's initial analysis.

**->** This collaborative approach fosters a well-defended and clear system. By incorporating the insights of these entities alongside the UAP's assessment, **LaunchPoint** offers multiple layers of scrutiny for potential investors. This multi-faceted evaluation minimizes potential risks and ensures only the most promising ventures progress within the LaunchPoint ecosystem.
