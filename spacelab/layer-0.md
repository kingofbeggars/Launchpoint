### The first layer of curation

* **LaunchPoint** prioritizes investor confidence by implementing a robust, multi-layered curation system for projects seeking liquidity on its platform. The initial and critical stage hinges on a core filtering criterion - the **Unbiased Anon Protocol** (UAP).
* Serving as the initial cornerstone of the curation process, the UAP, comprised of LaunchPoint's core team and key contributors, evaluates each project. This in-depth analysis ensures only ventures demonstrating genuine potential and meeting stringent standards progress further within the curation process.
* This initial filtering serves as the foundation for subsequent stages. By establishing a clear and rigorous assessment at the outset, LaunchPoint fosters a secure and transparent environment for investors within the Solana ecosystem.
